# psa-update
CLI alternative to PSA (Peugeot / CitroÃ«n / Opel) NAC / RCC firmware update, hopefully more robust

Features:
- Download of RCC / NAC firmware updates
- Resume of download in case of failure
- Preparation of USB device for car system update

Not yet implemented:
- Map update for NAC
- Parallel download

# Usage

Command line can be invoked using vehicle VIN as a parameter:

This will check for available RCC / NAC updates, and interactively ask for download and extraction of the firmware update to a USB device.
